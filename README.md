# autobilu

Simple set of scripts, templates, and wav files needed to automate fireworks shows using the Biliusocn firing system.  Requires raspberry-pi running latest version of rpitx.  Also requires sox on your script building machine, and a google fireworks cue sheet (see sample https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wXlmMq8mZJ9MuPj-t7BJZPjg7rnDfTCum9ro5zBIKOc/edit?usp=sharing).
